# agro-cart
Recently it has been quite difficult to find fresh foods in markets, especially fruits and vegetables. In this case, if the agro products can somehow be directly purchased from the farms, people may find the products fresh and without any harmful medicine applied. So Agro cart comes with the solution here.

<h1> Purpose</h1>
 The purpose of this software is to let people be sure and confident about the agro products they are buying by letting them directly purchase from the farmers. Moreover, it aims to provide products at lesser prices by removing any third party involved between the farmers and customers. It also aims to make farmers easily handle their accounts by keeping all the transaction history online.
